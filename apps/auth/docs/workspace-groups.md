# Workspace groups

Lets a Google Workspace admin grant a volunteer access to a feature or app by
adding them to a Google Group (e.g. `digital-services@sdfwa.org`). The auth app reads
each volunteer's groups from the Admin SDK, strips the `@sdfwa.org` suffix,
and stamps the bare names (`digital-services`, `shop-managers`, …) onto the session
and the JWT, so consumer apps can gate features without their own role tables.

## How it works

```
Google sign-in
   │
   ▼
databaseHooks.account.create.after
   │  ── upsert volunteers row
   │  ── fetchUserGroups(email) via Admin SDK
   ▼
volunteers.groups + last_groups_sync_at  (Postgres text[])
   │
   ▼
customSession enriches every session payload with groups
   │
   ▼
GET /api/session  → groups in `user`
GET /api/user     → groups on volunteer + top-level
POST /api/auth/jwt-refresh → groups claim in JWT
   │
   ▼
@sdfwa/auth-client → requireGroup / hasGroup / useUser().groups
```

Sync runs in two places:

1. **On every Google sign-in** via the `account.create.after` hook (after the
   volunteer row upsert). A failure here never blocks sign-in — groups stay at
   the last-known value and the staleness re-sync below picks it up later.
2. **On-demand inside `enforceActiveOrRevoke`** (which runs on every public
   session/JWT read). If `last_groups_sync_at` is null or older than 10 minutes,
   it re-fetches before returning the session. If Workspace responds 404 (user
   no longer exists), the Better-Auth session is deleted and the user is signed
   out across the ecosystem on the next request.

Members get `groups: []`. Group-gated routes will reject members just like they
reject anonymous users.

### Allowlist and normalization

There is no curated allowlist. We accept every group whose email ends in
`@sdfwa.org` (case-insensitive). The OAuth consent screen is **Internal**, so
only Workspace users sign in; the suffix filter is defense-in-depth against
external groups Workspace might surface.

Groups are stored as **bare names**, lowercase, with the `@sdfwa.org` suffix
stripped — `digital-services@sdfwa.org` becomes `"digital-services"` in the database, the
session payload, the JWT claim, and every `requireGroup` / `hasGroup` call.
The domain is implied. If you ever need to reach a group from non-Workspace
code (e.g. to email it), reattach `@sdfwa.org`.

## Workspace admin setup

One-time. Requires a Workspace super-admin.

1. **GCP project**: in the same project as the OAuth client (e.g. "SDFWA SSO"),
   go to **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create service account**.
   - Name: `auth-directory-reader`. No project roles.
2. **Enable the Admin SDK API** in the same GCP project: **APIs & Services →
   Enabled APIs & services → + Enable APIs and Services → search "Admin SDK
   API" → Enable**. Without this the Directory API returns 403 even with DWD
   correctly set up.
3. **Domain-wide delegation**: open the new service account, **Show advanced
   settings**, copy the **Client ID** (a long numeric string, ~21 digits — not
   the service account email).
4. **Workspace admin console** (admin.google.com):
   - **Security → Access and data control → API controls → Manage Domain Wide
     Delegation**.
   - **Add new**.
   - Paste the Client ID from step 3.
   - OAuth scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`
5. **Service account key**: back in GCP, on the service account, **Keys → Add
   key → Create new key → JSON**. Download.
6. **Impersonation subject**: pick a real Workspace **user** (not a group, not
   an alias) the service account will impersonate. The user does not need to
   log in anywhere; they just need to exist and not be suspended.
7. **Grant the impersonation subject an admin role with directory-read
   permission.** DWD lets the service account act *as* the user, but it does
   not grant the user any new powers. In **admin.google.com → Account → Admin
   roles**, assign the impersonation subject the **Groups Reader** prebuilt
   role (least-privilege option), or a custom role with just *Admin API
   privileges → Groups → Read*. Avoid Super Admin — DWD makes the subject's
   privileges reachable from the app's env. Without this the Directory API
   returns 403 "Not Authorized to access this resource/api".

## Env vars

| Var | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_B64` (secret) | `base64 -w0 < service-account.json` |
| `GOOGLE_ADMIN_IMPERSONATION_SUBJECT` | e.g. `digital-services` |

Both must be set for group sync to run. If either is missing, the admin client
logs `google_admin_config_missing` once and returns `{ status: "skipped" }`,
which means **sign-in still works but groups stay at the last-known value**.
Useful for local dev without service-account creds.

## Sync behavior summary

| Trigger | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Volunteer Google sign-in | Sync; on success update `groups` + `last_groups_sync_at`. |
| Any `/api/session` or `/api/user` read | If `last_groups_sync_at` is null or > 10 min old, re-sync inline before returning. |
| Admin SDK 404 (user removed from Workspace) | Better-Auth session deleted, structured log `session_revoked_volunteer_not_in_workspace`. |
| Admin SDK 5xx or timeout | Session left intact, log `google_admin_groups_fetch_failed`; staleness retries on next request. |

Revocation lag for a user removed from a group:

- The next session read after their last sync hits the 10-min staleness check
  and re-syncs. So group removal propagates within ~10 minutes.
- A JWT minted via `/api/auth/jwt-refresh` is good until its `exp` (15 min by
  default). Consumer apps using local JWT verify see the new groups on the
  next refresh.

## Consuming groups in apps

```ts
import { requireGroup } from "@sdfwa/auth-client/server";

await requireGroup(cookieHeader, "digital-services");
// or any-of:
await requireGroup(cookieHeader, ["digital-services", "shop-managers"]);
```

Pure predicates for middleware / client checks:

```ts
import { hasGroup, hasAnyGroup, hasAllGroups } from "@sdfwa/auth-client";

if (!hasGroup(session.user.groups, "digital-services")) return null;
```

## Common failures

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| Log: `google_admin_config_missing` | One of the env vars is unset. |
| Log: `google_admin_token_exchange_failed` with `unauthorized_client` | DWD not authorized in Workspace admin console; wrong Client ID (must be the service account's numeric OAuth client ID, not its email); or wrong scope listed there. |
| Log: `google_admin_token_exchange_failed` with `invalid_grant` | Impersonation subject is suspended, doesn't exist, or is a group/alias rather than a real user. |
| Log: `google_admin_groups_fetch_failed` with status 403 `"Not Authorized to access this resource/api"` | Either the Admin SDK API is not enabled in the GCP project, or the impersonation subject lacks an admin role with Groups → Read. Setup steps 2 and 7. |
| Volunteer signs in but `groups` is `[]` | Either DWD not set up yet, or the user is not in any `@sdfwa.org` group. Test with `/api/Contacts`-style direct call via the script in [verification](#verification). |
| `session_revoked_volunteer_not_in_workspace` for an active user | Impersonation subject lacks permission to read other users (rare — promote them or pick a different subject). |

## Verification

Local script (don't commit):

```ts
// apps/auth/scripts/test-admin.ts
import { fetchUserGroups } from "@/lib/google/admin-client";
console.log(await fetchUserGroups("you@sdfwa.org"));
```

```bash
cd apps/auth && bun run scripts/test-admin.ts
```

After deploy:

```bash
curl -s https://auth.sdfwa.org/api/session -H "Cookie: $COOKIE" | jq .user.groups
```

## Key rotation

If the service-account key leaks: in GCP, on the same service account, **Add
key** (new JSON), update `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_B64` in Dokploy, redeploy,
then delete the compromised key. The DWD authorization is on the Client ID,
which is unchanged across key rotations.
